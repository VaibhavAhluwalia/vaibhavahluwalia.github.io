  I’m Vaibhav Ahluwalia, a machine learning engineer guided by a deep interest in
  understanding how systems work in the real world. I’m drawn to careful learning
  and sustained thinking—exploring ideas from multiple angles and steadily refining
  the quality of my understanding.
</p>

<p>
  My work focuses on designing, deploying, and reasoning about machine learning
  systems that move beyond experimentation and into sustained use. I work across
  the lifecycle of ML systems—from modeling and feature design to system
  architecture and deployment—where performance, reliability, and practical
  constraints all matter.
</p>

<p>
  I’m particularly interested in problems where modeling choices interact closely
  with data, infrastructure, and product considerations. These intersections often
  shape how systems evolve over time and tend to have a greater impact than
  individual algorithms in isolation.
</p>

<p>
  I spend much of my time reading and learning, and sometimes writing to organize
  my thoughts. Writing helps me think more clearly, explore ideas from different
  angles, and understand how concepts translate from controlled settings into real
  applications.
</p>

<p>
  I value thoughtful collaboration, careful engineering, and work that rewards
  long-term thinking. I enjoy staying inquisitive, learning continuously, and
  building with intention.
