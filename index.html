    I’m Vaibhav Ahluwalia, a machine learning engineer working on systems that
    operate in real-world production environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work spans the lifecycle of machine learning systems, from modeling and
    feature design to system architecture and deployment. I’ve primarily worked
    on ranking systems, language-augmented workflows, and decision systems that
    must perform reliably under practical constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m interested in how modeling choices interact with data, infrastructure,
    and product requirements, and how these interactions shape system behavior
    over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    I spend time reading and occasionally writing. I’m interested in collaborating
    on problems involving machine learning systems and applied infrastructure.
