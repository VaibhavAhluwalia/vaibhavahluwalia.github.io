  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m Vaibhav Ahluwalia, a machine learning engineer interested in understanding
    how machine learning systems operate in real-world settings. I’m drawn to
    careful learning and sustained thinking, and to building systems that remain
    useful beyond initial experimentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    My work focuses on designing, deploying, and reasoning about machine learning
    systems that move into sustained production use. I work across the lifecycle
    of ML systems—from modeling and feature design to system architecture and
    deployment—where performance, reliability, and practical constraints all
    matter.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m particularly interested in problems where modeling choices interact
    closely with data, infrastructure, and product considerations. These
    interactions often shape how systems evolve over time more than individual
    algorithms in isolation.
  </p>

  <p>
    I spend much of my time reading and learning, and sometimes writing to clarify
    my thinking. I value thoughtful collaboration, careful engineering, and work
    that rewards long-term thinking.
