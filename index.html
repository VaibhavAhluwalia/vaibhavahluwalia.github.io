    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Recommendation System:</b>
        Designed and deployed a production-grade learning-to-rank model to match
        user requests with optimal service provider groups using custom feature
        engineering and offline evaluation strategies.
      </li>

      <li>
        Built end-to-end ML pipelines supporting both real-time and batch inference,
        orchestrated using Union.ai (Flyte), with feature store integration.
      </li>

      <li>
        Deployed ML services using BentoML, Docker, and Kubernetes on GCP, with
        drift monitoring via feature and score distribution tracking in BigQuery.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>LLM-Based Review Summarization:</b>
        Designed and deployed an agentic LLM pipeline to ingest, filter, and
        abstractively summarize large volumes of customer feedback with
        volume- and freshness-based triggers.
      </li>

      <li>
        <b>Dynamic Pricing System:</b>
        Designed a demand- and capacity-aware pricing framework using historical,
        temporal, and regional features. Conducted pricing sensitivity and
        elasticity analysis to support near real-time price adjustments.
      </li>
