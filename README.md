I’m a Machine Learning Engineer focused on building **ranking and recommendation systems** for marketplaces.  I work on taking ML models from **POC to production**, with experience in learning-to-rank, GenAI systems, and MLOps.   I care about **systems that improve real business metrics**, not just offline scores.
